## The objective of this project is to analyze mobile application usage behavior over a one-month period using an interactive Power BI dashboard. The dataset represents detailed mobile app analytics collected during August 2024, offering a granular look into how users interact with various applications on a daily basis. With a total of 200 entries, this structured dataset captures essential metrics that reflect digital habits and app engagement patterns.

Each record in the dataset contains five key attributes: the date, the app name, the total number of minutes the app was used, the number of notifications received from the app, and the number of times the app was opened on that particular day. The dataset covers widely-used apps such as Instagram, WhatsApp, Netflix, Facebook, YouTube, and others, making the analysis relevant to a broad range of user behaviors. The consistency in data structure allows for accurate aggregations and visual exploration of trends in screen time, app interactions, and notification engagement.

To derive actionable insights from this data, a fully functional and interactive Power BI dashboard was developed. This dashboard translates raw numbers into meaningful visualizations, offering an intuitive interface for data interpretation. At the top of the dashboard, a KPI section presents high-level summaries of core metrics: Total Usage Minutes, Total Notifications Received, Total App Opens, and the Date Range of the data. These KPIs provide users with an immediate understanding of overall mobile activity for the month.

To facilitate deeper exploration, the dashboard features a bar chart that displays total usage time by app, allowing for a quick comparison of which applications consumed the most screen time. A donut chart further visualizes the percentage share of usage across all apps, highlighting which platforms dominate the user’s attention. Meanwhile, a line chart illustrates daily usage trends, enabling viewers to identify patterns, spikes, or drops in engagement over time—useful for correlating usage with external events, holidays, or behavioral shifts.

One of the key interactive elements of the dashboard is the dropdown filter that enables users to select a specific application. Upon selection, all charts and KPIs adjust dynamically to reflect metrics for that app only. This feature empowers users to conduct app-specific analysis and compare behaviors across different platforms with ease.

Overall, this Power BI dashboard serves as a comprehensive tool for understanding digital behavior at a daily and per-app level. It offers users, analysts, or digital wellness researchers the ability to answer important questions such as: Which apps are most time-consuming? How do notifications influence engagement? Are there days with significantly higher usage? By turning granular app usage data into digestible visuals and summaries, this dashboard supports informed decision-making about digital wellbeing and user interaction trends.

In conclusion, the integration of this well-structured dataset with Power BI’s advanced visualization capabilities has resulted in a powerful and user-friendly analytics tool. It not only provides a snapshot of user behavior but also promotes greater awareness of screen time and app dependence—an increasingly important concern in the digital age.
